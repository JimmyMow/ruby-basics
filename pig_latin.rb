# PIG LATIN CHALLENGE
#
# For this challenge, you'll need to encode sentences into pig latin, and also decode them.
#
# You'll need to write two methods: one to encode, and one to decode.
#
# Examples:
#
# "ruby rules" becomes "ubyray ulesray"
# "go blackhawks" becomes "ogay lackhawksbay"
# "apples are happpy fruit" becomes "applesay areay appyhay ruitfay"
#
# Encoding rules are widely debated, so here are some simple ones to get us started:
#
# 1. If a word starts with a consonant, move it to the end of the word, and then add "ay"
# 2. If a word starts with a vowel, simply add "ay" to the end of the word.
#
# After you can encode, try to decode!
#
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# If you want to get fancy, try one or more of these:
#
# 3. If a word starts with a consonant cluster, like "challenge", move the cluster: "allengechay"
# 4. If a word starts with a Y, consider it to be a consonant, but all other Ys are vowels.
# 5. The entire rulebook at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin#Rules
#
# Here are some sentences to get you started:
#
# address = "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."
# ruby = "Ruby gives us lots of data containers to choose from"
#
# oodgay ucklay!
